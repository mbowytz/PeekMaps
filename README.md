# PeekMaps
Project I worked on circa 2009-2010 that tracked Peek email device locations and allow users to share them via widgets. It was also one of the first apps to use Foursquare's API!

It used the Xtify API (the Peeks were "Xtified" after a user authorized their being tracked) to get an approximate location.

It was a lot of work but was completely fun and I learned a LOT about how cell phones determine their location and math involved with lat/long. This is the last version of the site and is good for showing off that I can indeed code in PHP.

About the visuals: I am not a great web designer but I thought that it looked OK.

Mashable was kind enough to grab a screenshot years ago:
